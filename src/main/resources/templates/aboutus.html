            <p class = "caption">I am a Software Development Engineer Apprentice at AWS. My background is in Mechanical Engineering and Environmental Science, which I studied in undergrad. Shortly after graduating from undergrad I decided to take my career in a different direction and pursue software engineering. I spent about a year and a half learning Web Design and Development on my own before taking a job as a webmaster at a small company. From there I continued to develop my skills by enrolling in a software engineering immersion program where I studied advanced JavaScript on both the front and back end, frameworks such as React and AngularJS, RESTful APIs, Agile methodologies, functional and object-oriented programming. Shortly after graduating I joined AWS as an apprentice on the Payments & Processing team where I will be an apprentice for a year - Jhia

            <p class = "caption">I started my career working in the military as an intelligence analyst. After the military I started working for Google as a Team lead for a specialized team that would map out not the outside world, but the “inside” world. My team mapped out inside malls, best buys, home depots, airports etc. Then I started working for Microsoft first as a Data Analyst and then worked my way into a Project Manager role. Where it involved quite a bit of data mining, SQL Querying, Report Generating for senior leadership. I led projects that involved process improvements which cut process-oriented work in half. Soon after, I was invited to come join Amazon Instant Video team (known now as Prime Video) and work with the metadata team as a Program Manager. I left Amazon to pursue a once in a lifetime opportunity to caddie for my brother-in-law on the PGA tour. When I decided to come back to corporate, I wanted to come back to where my passion lies and that’s in Software Development. - Paolo</p>
