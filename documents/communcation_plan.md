## Communication plan
The team is on Slack together in a group channel which will be the teams main mode of communication when not at CodeFellows. At a minimum we will check in together once a day for a standup amongst ourselves to gauge progress and adjust accordingly. The team will allow each member to be heard without interruption. If deemed appropriate the team will renegotiate requirements and assignments to ensure everyone stays in the mind set of solving a mutual problem to get desired results. Each team member will provide ongoing and honest feedback.

## Conflict plan
The conflict plan will have 2 main goals. Get the team back on track quickly and leverage the resolution process to our advantage. We will approach conflict as an expected outcome of team dynamics and use it as an opportunity for creativity in dealing with unexpected problems. We agree to these rules and premises: We are smarter as a group than individually. We will manage or emotions. The entire team will be involved. If resolution can’t be found amongst the team we will ask a TA or instructor to mediate.

## Work plan
The team will approach the work using the Amazon principle of being owners.  We will think long term and won’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. Most importantly each individual will act on behalf of the entire team and never say “that’s not my job.” We will use a project management system to break down tasks, make estimates, and assign tasks to team members. Once a task is deemed complete at least one other team member will review it prior to marking it complete in the project plan.

## Git process
Each team member will work on their own branch, switching branches when a task is complete and prior to starting a new task. All PRs must be reviewed by at least one other team member prior to being merged to the master branch. Each team member will be required to pull from master and test their branch with the current master branch  prior to creating a PR.
